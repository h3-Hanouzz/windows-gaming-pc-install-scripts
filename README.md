# A Windows Gaming PC program automation script
Essentially what I use instead of Ninite because it can be configured to do more than install stuff. So far, I have it set up to disable sticky/toggle/filter keys. If you are interested in contributing, emailing me or DMing me on Twitter is probably the fastest way I'll respond (links on my GitHub profile.) This will need to be run as administrator in order to work properly.
